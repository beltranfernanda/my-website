                        <p>
                            Since childhood, I've been fascinated by computers. 
                            My early days were spent playing online games, but a pivotal moment came when I was 8. 
                            My aunt and uncle moved abroad, leaving me as the only person at home who knew how to 
                            communicate grandma with them through Messenger. I also became the go-to person for using 
                            our home computer. This marked the beginning of my journey as a computer enthusiast. I started 
                            to provide support for our family computer and internet network, laying the foundation for my passion 
                            for technology.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> 
                            After graduating from high school, I was passionate about pursuing a career in computer engineering. 
                            I applied and was admitted to a prestigious 3-year engineering program at one of the best universities 
                            in my city. My journey into the tech world began in earnest in 2019 with an internship in QA. 
                            Six months later, the company recognized my potential and offered me a full-time contract as a 
                            software developer through a bootcamp program. Over the next two years, I honed my skills as a 
                            full-stack developer, working with technologies like Java, JavaScript, Liferay, CSS, HTML, and Spring MVC.

                        <br>
                        <p> 
                            In 2021, an opportunity with one of Latin America's leading e-commerce companies led me to work as a software 
                            developer, where I expanded my tech stack to include Golang, React, Node.js, Spring Boot, Kibana, and New 
                            Relic, among others.

                            August 2023 marked a significant turning point in my life—I moved to Canada. This decision brought about a 
                            fresh start in many aspects of my life. Since then, I've been dedicated to improving my English, focusing on 
                            my mental health, exploring other industries, working on personal projects, and uncovering the secrets to 
                            happiness.
