                        <p>
                            Since childhood, I've been fascinated by computers. 
                            My early days were spent playing online games, but a pivotal moment came when I was 8. 
                            My aunt and uncle moved abroad, leaving me as the only person at home who knew how to 
                            communicate grandma with them through Messenger. I also became the go-to person for using 
                            our home computer. This marked the beginning of my journey as a computer enthusiast. I started 
                            to provide support for our family computer and internet network, laying the foundation for my passion 
                            for technology.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p> 
                            After graduating from high school, I pursued my passion for technology by enrolling in a prestigious computer 
                            engineering program in my city and gaining admission to one of the top engineering universities there. 
                            In 2019, I embarked on my professional journey with an internship in QA, which quickly evolved into 
                            a full-time software developer role through a boot camp program. Over two years, I honed my skills 
                            in web development as a full-stack developer, utilizing technologies such as Java, JavaScript, Liferay, 
                            CSS, HTML, and Spring MVC.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            In 2021, an opportunity at one of Latin America's leading e-commerce companies marked the next chapter 
                            of my career. There, I expanded my technical repertoire with tools like Golang, React, Node.js, Spring Boot, 
                            Kibana, and New Relic, contributing for two years.

                        <p>
                            Seeking further growth, I moved to Canada in August 2023. This transition was not just geographical but also 
                            personal and professional. I have been dedicated to improving my English, focusing on my mental health, and 
                            exploring new industries. Alongside, I'm building my projects and unravelling the secrets to happiness.
